Put some time into this while working on a personal project utilizing Google Cloud and flutter. No idea why i am keeping this here but i dont see a reason to remove it.

**Potentional employers:** If you want to hear about the actual project, please contact me. It is currently in a private repo due to security concerns :)

## FlutterFire Codelab: Friendly Eats
A cross-platform Flutter port of the "Friendly Eats" Firestore codelab.
